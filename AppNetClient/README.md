AppNetClient
============


This is a demo application for the ChaiONE code challenge. 


App Requirements:

Create an App.net client that just lists the most recent posts from the public timeline.

    Each post should be rendered in a table view cell, with the most recent at the top.
    Each cell should contain the user’s avatar (bonus if the corners are rounded)
    Each cell should contain the poster’s name in bold
    Each cell should contain the post text, and be variable height, depending on the text size
    Pull to refresh should be implemented to refresh the timeline
    The list should scroll quickly, without dropping frames on an iPhone 5
    The latest publicly released iOS SDK should be used
    Use of third party libraries are allowed but are not required
